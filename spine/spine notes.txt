Notes: 
- the textures aren't packed efficiently. Should the texture size be smaller?
- skin has extra textures for the circles - will that be removed by the end?
- full body is currently separating the pants and shirt - please move it into a single texture for shirt and pants (see the 'shirt/dress')
- colors in skeleton - this should generally be left uncolored to allow for tinting
- missing size information in the json file
- setup for direction 
-- is that final or just demo?
